### What I learned

This was very fun project to do as this game was one of the best games for me when I was a child. This game was the judge of every discussion and ... for us growing up. I started learning framer-motion library while doing my last project and now I am better. I used it to do ease motions for the items in the app.

### Continued development

In the future I will make the option to play : Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
